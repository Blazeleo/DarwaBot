Describe, item by item, all changes you'd like to propose. Write them in a list, one proposition per line. For example:  

- Adds `DoStuff()` method to service X.  
- Changes `SomeMethod()` on service Y, so it can handle situation Z better.  
- Added a try/catch *somewhere*, so an exception is not thrown on the console when *something* happens.  
- Replaced `AMethod()` by `AnotherMethod()` in *some command* for performance reasons.
